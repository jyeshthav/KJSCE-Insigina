    <string name="overview">We are the Official Art team of K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Vidyavihar.
        We create decor like paintings, hangings and 3D art pieces for our college fests.
        So far we have been creating art decor for - Flash mob, Freshers Eve, Abhiyantriki, Parvaah, Skream, Symphony, Naari and Farewell.
        We also collaborate with various organisations like TedxSVV, Makermela, NGOs and also helped out
        Parvaah for the beautification of Ghatkopar Railway Station.
        Art is not only about what you see, but what you make others see, and Team KJSCE Insignia has
        successfully shown the beauty in art through the artwork made by its team members.
